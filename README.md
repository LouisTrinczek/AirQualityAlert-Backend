## 🌱 About the Project

### 💡 How it all started

This project was originally born out of a joke from my mother. Living in the countryside, she would often hang out freshly washed clothes to dry – only to find out too late that a farmer had started spreading manure nearby. The result? The clothes had to be washed again.

While this was frustrating at times, we all recognize that farmers play an essential role in our communities. Their work is crucial, and spreading manure is just one of many necessary tasks. Instead of complaints, this project aims to **bridge the gap between farmers and nearby residents** by providing a simple, community-driven way to share air quality-related updates.

### 🔔 What is AirQualityAlert?

**AirQualityAlert** is an open-source **notification system** that allows residents to stay informed about **temporary air quality disturbances** in their area.

🚜 **Why?** Many local activities may **temporarily impact air quality** – such as manure spreading, controlled burns, or heavy dust from construction sites. With **AirQualityAlert**, these activities can be **communicated in advance**, helping nearby residents prepare while supporting the essential work of farmers, businesses, and local communities.

### 👥 Who is it for?

✅ **Farmers** – Notify nearby residents **before spreading manure** or conducting fieldwork that may generate dust.  
🏗 **Construction Companies** – Alert communities about **dust-heavy activities** like demolition or roadwork.  
🏠 **Residents & Businesses** – Share updates about **firewood burning, industrial emissions, or smoke-generating events**.  
🚛 **Local Governments** – Provide alerts about **air quality incidents** and integrate with **official air quality data**.
